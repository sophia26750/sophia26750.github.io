# My STEM journey


From a young age, Sophia has always been in love with STEM. She always excelled in science and math while struggling a little more with reading comprehensions. She could be seen all over the place with science on her mind, whether that'll be sneaking time in to read about Astronomy, joining programs held by the Science Museum of Minnesota annually, learning coding on her own through online courses, volunteering at the Arizona Science Center, tutoring STEM courses at school, and even joining a rigorous STEM summer program focusing on Astrophysics! These were all the small steps that led to Sophia's passion in STEM today!


I have always had a passion for STEM since I was little, finding myself gravitating towards finding interest in the mechanics, the coding, and the mathematics behind life. Starting from the age of six, I would annually join clubs and week-long programs hosted by the Science Museum of Minnesota, learning a multitude of topics such as criminology, veterinarian, electronics, and more! Even in school, I noticed my passion and love for chemistry, physics, and calculus outshined my other classes by a landslide. I found it fascinating how as I grew older, every topic I have learned (starting from basic algebra all the way to AP Chemistry) began to all tie together, to work together, to discover and change our world. (I still remember my reaction when I realized polarization in Chemistry and celestial coordinates on a sphere are directly linked to calculus itself--specifically 3D polar coordinates).   


After starting highschool, I began to realize that I can apply my knowledge towards helping my community. That's when I began to join the Tutoring Club, helping students as often as I can with STEM. As I began to volunteer more and reflect on the concepts I learn in STEM, I began to realize the inevitable connection STEM has with everything around me. Even in history, I began to realize just how important every subject was in order to squeeze out the most optimal technological innovation to help the world. For example, one must understand politics, world history, and even the philosophy of humans in order to craft the perfect tool to aid those in need. I came to the revelation that everything I am learning and have learned up to this point has all reached a point of intersection, bound so closely and intricately, consistently pushing each other higher towards improving our world. This drove me to always try my best and enjoy my academics/extracurriculars of all shapes and sizes, realizing they all come together in the end to improve myself, which in turn, can help my community.


As I volunteered more and more, I began to realize I wanted to promote my small business in a more personalized way: through my own website. I began by learning steps to python coding, learning the basics with my dad and free online courses. Later on, with the help of my dad, I was able to apply to GitHub with my code, saving my work onto a cloud server where other coders like me are able to explore and use my code! With my growing coding knowledge, I learned how to code HTML to promote and improve the 8 Foundation Website; I programmed this website to promote my small business and act as a hub for others who wish to volunteer, code, and give back to the community a chance to communicate with me; I learned how to code in Java for the AP Computer Science A exam; I was able to write a paper exploring LSTM/deep learning models; I was able to code a website that explores a Lagrangian Approach to Scalable Mixed Constraint Portfolio Optimization (which won first place in the Arizona Science Fair (AZSEF) Software Engineer program); and I was driven to join the new Engineering course offered by my school (which taught me how to code Arduino, architecture, and Rube Goldberg machines).

For a more direct approach to participate in my community, I began to volunteer at the Arizona Science center, where I was given the opportunity to teach children and adults of all ages the vitality and thrill of Science. I was able to run and lead small events that provide an inclusive and interactive learning experience for all, allowing me to practice my communication skills, teaching skills, and leading skills. From there, I practiced--and fell in love--with pushing myself in a more public and inclusive environment.

Upon volunteering, I began to seek out more opportunities around me until I found the Yale Summer Program of Astrophysics (YSPA). I have never heard of this program before, nor did I think I could get into such a prestigious opportunity. However, knowing I have limited resources and opportunities offered here regarding Astronomy and experiencing a college life, I decided to apply. I thought *I might as well try. This is an opportunity to learn how to code, how to integrate calculus, how to use the newest technologies, and how to apply science into modern research.* When I got in, I was ecstatic. This is an opportunity to really hone into what I truly love within the wide range of STEM!


Upon living at Yale and participating in the program. I learned many skills I have never even thought about before. I was able to automate an entire program myself that calculated the magnitudes of a supernova. I photographed images of galaxies, star clusters, and even a nebula. With the calculated magnitudes of a star, I was able to classify what type of supernova SN2025MVN was, estimate the age of my star cluster (NCG6871), and render an image of the Eagle Nebula!

From this program, I worked with a multitude of people all over America, ranging from South Carolina, to California, to Manhattan! This was an experience that forever reshaped my life. Upon leaving this program, I became a much more initiative person, where I'm not scared to communicate with those around me anymore. I refined my coding skills, research skills, and my learning skills. I worked hard in this program, and it taught me many things that I would never forget.


With this new-found confidence and love for STEM, I came back to senior year with even more determination than before! After becoming president of the Tutoring club, aside from personal tutoring and pairing up students with tutors for the entire school, I began to host large group tutoring sessions for those taking AP Physics to prepare them for upcoming quizzes, tests, and the advance placement exam. Furthermore, I began to step out of my comfort zone and worked with a student I never have worked with before to kickstart a children's book activity, encouraging culture clubs, STEM clubs, and other extracurriculars to work together as club, promoting education for schools, refugees, and individuals that may not be able to afford or access these while encouraging individuals in school to expand their knowledge of cultures and STEM. I also joined the Makers of Change, where my team of five people designs a model to help a child learn and have fun despite diabilities. Even though I lack some of the engineering experience, I wanted to push myself and explore new implications of technology to help inidviduals. 


Academically, I have also worked hard to maintain my grades in all courses, but specifically my STEM courses. This was not easy, as Gilbert Classical Academy (GCA) was notorious for its rigorous academics. However, I never viewed my STEM courses as an obligation; I always viewed them as a fun hobby. I would find myself enjoying Calculus homework or Chemistry homework, relaxing my mind as I dove into the calculations, algorithms, and logical steps of solving a problem. Solving a STEM problem is just like solving a problem in life: focus on one problem at a time until the final solution reveals itself. With this ideology, I enthusiastically took my meticulous courses head-on, working hard on concepts I couldn't understand (sometimes even spending hours on one problem to understand all corners of solving it) and asking questions if needed. Even when I self-studied AP Computer Science, I would tell myself to take each problem head-on, solving one line at a time, and try to understand things with a holistic eye.
With this, I was able to achieve scores that I was proud of in my Dual enrollment and AP classes:


| Course                                      | Score/Grade           |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| AP Computer Science A                       | 4                      |
| AP Physics 1                                | 5                      |
| AP Calculus BC                              | 5                      |
| Calculus III/Diff EQ (Dual Enrollment)      | A in both semesters    |



I am beyond happy with the contributions I was able to make over my years and watching myself grow into the comfort of STEM, glad I was able to share my passion with those around me while continuing learning it in a positive light. STEM is truly a topic that will never leave my heart, and I hope to be able to deepen my knowledge forever as I move into my years of college.
