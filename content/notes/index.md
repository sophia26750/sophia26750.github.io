# Art to Heart! 

Outside of art, Sophia also loves to perform for her community. She currently plays the Guzheng (Chinese Zither) outside of school for senior citizens, asian festivals, performances, and more! See below for images!

With the 8 Foundation, she is able to express the Chinese culture while playing her favorite instrument. Usually, she plays duets with her sister, Sabrina, who also plays the Chinese zither. Together, they love being able to perform and spread their music!
