# How to order! 

My orders are custom orders centered around my client's wishes. My vision with my final products is to artisically create a product that holds a special place in my client's hearts. In order to acccomplish this, it will take a quick second to require an email conversation about their vision.   

In order to deliver the best possible product, I would love to understand my client's vision. To achieve this, I hope you are okay with emailing me about your visions. I will try to email back as fast as I can! 

You could request anything that you wish to see such as:

1. What is wished to be painted 
2. What item the art should be painted on (Examples: canvas, paper, tote bag, etc.)
3. What media do you wish to see this product in (please visit _ART EXAMPLES_ for media references, but I always love to try new medias as well)
4. Anything else you would request I would be more than willing to hear!

The prices of my products may vary depending on your vision. Usually, an estimated price range would be $20-$40.
